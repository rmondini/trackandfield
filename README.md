# tracknfieldproject

We analyze the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) 100-meter and 200-meter all-time men and women lists. The code is written in Python 2 and contained in a Jupyter notebook.  

The code does the following:  

- Scrapes data from the IAAF website  
- Builds Pandas DataFrames containing all the relevant information  
- Performs several analyses on the 100m lists and produces plots to visualize the findings  
- Uses Machine Learning tools to build different regression models that predict 200m performances based on 100m performances  
- Compares the different models to determine which is the best one.  
  
See the code for more details and references.
