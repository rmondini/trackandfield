We analyze the World Athletics (formerly known as International Association of Athletics Federations - IAAF) 100-meter and 200-meter all-time men and women lists. The code is written in Python 3 and contained in a Jupyter notebook.  

The code does the following:  

- Scrapes data from the World Athletics website  
- Builds Pandas DataFrames containing all the relevant information  
- Performs data cleaning and pre-processing
- Performs several exploratory analyses on the 100m lists and produces plots to visualize the findings  
- Uses Machine Learning tools to build different regression models that predict an athlete's 200m Personal Best (PB) based on their 100m PB, age at 100m PB, gender, and nationality 
- Compares the different models to determine which is the most accurate one.  
  
See the jupyter notebook for many more details and references.
